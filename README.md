## Manipulators_library is a MATLAB Simulink library with models of three types of the most popular manipulators and examples of input signals. The models allow you to make changes to the dimensions of the links, the number of links and the input signals. This allows researchers to use the library to validate their own hypotheses and test devices before implementing them.##
